    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carne asada fries are a local specialty found on the menus of restaurants primarily in the American Southwest, including San Diego, where it originated. The dish is also served at Petco Park and Dodger Stadium. By 2015, fast food chain Del Taco began to sell the item. It typically contains sliced Carne Asada, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream over a bed of crispy 
        fries.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound Carne Asada</li>
            <li>4 russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp avocado oil</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 tbsp guacamole</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the carne asada as per the those recipe instructions. Marinate the meat ahead of time, but you can grill it while your baking the fries.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>To make the fries, slice each russet potato in half, then half again. Slice each quarter into strips, then slice the strips into equally sized fries.</li>
            <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper and add the fries. You may need two baking trays to keep the fries on a single layer. Add the olive oil and spices and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Bake the fries for 25-30 minutes and use a spatula to flip the fries halfway through.</li>
            <li>To serve, place the fries on a plate, sprinkle with cheddar cheese and add the carne asada. Top with a dollop of guacamole and sour cream.
            </li>
