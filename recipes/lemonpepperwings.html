    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These lemon pepper wings are baked until crispy then basted with lemon pepper seasoning and melted butter. They’re an easy appetizer or dinner that’s as good or better as you can get in a restaurant!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lb chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/4 cup avocado oil (can also use canola)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F.</li>
        <li>Toss chicken wings and oil. Place wings on a wire rack set on a baking sheet, taking care not to crowd wings. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove wings from the oven. Mix melted butter and lemon-pepper seasoning and brush liberally onto wings (stir butter mixture as you go to make sure you have plenty of seasoning for each wing).</li>
        <li>Place on a platter and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
